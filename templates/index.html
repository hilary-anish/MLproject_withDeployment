                <p>While teens may seem invincible, having insurance is crucial. Health insurance can cover unexpected medical expenses due to accidents or illnesses.

            <h2 class="section-title">Insurance for Adults</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>For adults, insurance is a fundamental part of financial planning. Health insurance is essential for covering medical costs and maintaining access to healthcare. Life insurance ensures that dependents are financially secure in case of the policyholder's death. Moreover, auto and home insurance protect against significant financial losses from accidents and natural disasters. Having comprehensive insurance coverage helps adults safeguard their assets and provide for their families.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Insurance for the Elderly</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>As people age, their need for insurance becomes more pronounced. Health insurance is critical for covering the increased medical costs that come with aging. Long-term care insurance can help manage the expenses of nursing homes or in-home care, which are not typically covered by regular health insurance. Life insurance can also help cover end-of-life expenses and provide financial support to surviving family members. Ensuring adequate insurance coverage in later life is essential for maintaining financial stability and peace of mind.</p>
